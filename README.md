# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis, data pulled from Google and OpenWeather was combined to create a travel destination map. This dataset visualization can be used to plan a travel itinerary for global travel.

## Visual Demonstration

Below is an example DataFrame containing some of the data underlying the visual map:

The data is depicted as an overlay on a Google Map (via the Maps and Places APIs), complete with details about nearby hotels and local weather:

Additionally, a starting point, ending point, and three other waypoints can be specified and a route will be determined that intersects with all specified points:
